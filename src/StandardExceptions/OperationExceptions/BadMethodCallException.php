* Use this exception in the event that a method being called doesn't

* only at the PHP level and not at the user level but it was ported
* from the SPL just in case someone finds a reason for it although it
* seems highly unlikely to be usable in the PHP userland.
* 
* This exception is only used for backwards compatibility with
* SPL's BadMethodCallException.

* @deprecated in favor of \StandardExceptions\OperationExceptions\InvalidOperationException, will be removed in version 2.0
