/**
* Use this exception when the string being passed on to your function
* detects that the XML being passed on is of incorrect format and
* cannot be parsed correctly by your XML parser.
*
* Refrain from using this exception as a signal for invalid values that
* did not match the domain validation that occurs after parsed, 
* instead throw an InvalidValueException instead.
*
* Note: Since XML comes with schema validation that may enforce value
* validation, it is ok to throw InvaldXMLException when schema fails to
* validation structure before parsing, it still is a parse refusal by the
* XML parsing engine and not some domain validation that you coded.
